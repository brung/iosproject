GRKBarGraphView
===========
A UIView subclass which renders a one-item bar graph with an animatable percentage
property and configurable orientation, colors, etc. CALayers are used for drawing
efficiency and implicit animation.

### Installing

If you're using [CocoPods](http://cocopods.org) it's as simple as adding this to your `Podfile`:

	pod 'GRKBarGraphView'

otherwise, simply add the contents of the `GRKBarGraphView` subdirectory to your project.

### Documentation

`GRKBarGraphView` is to be used as you would any other UIView and will draw the bar graph
to fill its entire bounds. It looks best if relatively thin, as it has a one point border
by default.

The main API is documented in `GRKBarGraphView.h` but at its most basic:

	GRKBarGraphView *graphView = ...
	graphView.percent = 0.42f;

You can instantiate it as you would any other view, though it will use Autolayout
internally.

The color of the graph is determined by the `tintColor` of the view, but can be explicitly
configured, and it is capable of different colors for the bar and border.

Additional documentation is available in `GRKBarGraphView.h` and example usage
can be found in the GRKBarGraphViewTestApp source.
